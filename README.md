# SchoolListIt AI

## WordPress to Watson AI Integration
SchoolListIt and Watson integration will equip our platform in two ways:
1. User accessibility: text-to-speech is a requirement for children learning to read, and helpful for adults with accesibilty challenges. 

2. Learning from Analytics: if we have a good adoption rate, our platform will be gathering a 'fresh' set of data on how involved the extended family is with a child's education and how this can help. It is our hypothesis that equipping more involvement from grandparents and neighbors and friends will help in single family homes. 

For the purposes of the CallForCode submission, we are only able to address point one - integrating text to speech. 

It is our plan to work out the cooler stuff as we go on and gather more data.


## Installation

You need ths plugin installed and activated on the WP backend that serves your api to have the app read aloud to you. 

Download zip file
Open your wordpress dashboard - the wp-admin page on most sites - and click upload.
Install and Activate.

2. you must also have a folder called audio-files in the plugin folder to hold the files created. I added that to the gitignore file so it wouldnt upload to github. 
- in production I would create the folder -- but Im out of time...
