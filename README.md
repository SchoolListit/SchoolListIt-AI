# SchoolListIt AI

## WordPress to Watson AI Integration
SchoolListIt and Watson integration will equip our platform in two ways:
1. User accessibility: text-to-speech is a requirement for children learning to read, and helpful for adults with accesibilty challenges. 

2. Learning from Analytics: if we have a good adoption rate, our platform will be gathering a 'fresh' set of data on how involved the extended family is with a child's education and how this can help. It is our hypothesis that equipping more involvement from grandparents and neighbors and friends will help in single family homes. 

For the 'finished code' we are going to address point 1. and the other integrations will be left within our Roadmap.
